A hierarchical grid may be the best fit if one item on your page will always be more important than the surrounding elements. For example, hierarchical grids are great for online news platforms. If the content you need to display is highly variable, consider using a basic column or modular grid, as these provide lots of flexibility when designing. For example, elements and content can span across multiple columns or modules or just one to fit design needs.',

Determine the number of columns and the margin and gutter sizes relative to your screen sizes. You will most likely want to prepare for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. A 12-column grid at laptop or desktop size is generally flexible enough for most design needs. The number of columns will decrease as your device size decreases.
